# Skills To Add

This directory is used to queue requests for new skills to be added to the MCP Skills Hub.

## How to use
1. Create a new file in this directory.
2. Name the file after the skill you want to add (e.g. `pdf-extraction.md` or just `pdf-extraction`).
3. Inside the file, provide instructions, API documentation links, or examples of how the skill should work.
4. If you just have a name/idea, an empty file with a descriptive name is also fine.

## Workflow
- **Pending**: Files in this directory represent skills waiting to be implemented.
- **In Progress**: When work starts, the agent may move this file to `task.md` or a tracking issue.
- **Done**: Once implemented, the file will be deleted or moved to an archive.
